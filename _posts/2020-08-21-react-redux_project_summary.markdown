Out of all five projects from this program, this one was definitely the toughest one, so it felt rewarding to finish it the way I wanted to. Although it was. very frustrating to learn React at first, I still loved the structure and the principles that they want developers to follow when coding with React. I like how it looks clean and organized. Now, about the project...

I started out the project the way I did with the others, by setting up the files and applying CSS to all the pages where I was going to put content in. I wanted the visual first before getting into the hard stuff. Once everything looked how I wanted, I started making little goals for myself that would eventually lead to the finish line.

I didn't want to go overboard with my project since its my first time creating a project with React-Redux, so I thought of creating an app where a user can search and store their images. I got my api off a website that has tons of images of just about everything you can think of. I added a search bar, where the user can type something in and get results based on their query. If the user wants to store an image, they have to click on it, simple as that. 

I created a component where a user can delete their images. The images from this component comes from the rails api that I created to hold the images that the user wanted to keep in their account. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out a way to keep data from the redux store. All data vanishes once you refresh the page, so the rails api helped me maintain the data even if the user were to load the page again. 

This is pretty much it for my final project here at Flatiron School. It's truly been a life-changing experience for me. I will forever be grateful to Flatiron School for giving us such a great program that allows us to be the programmers that we want to become.
