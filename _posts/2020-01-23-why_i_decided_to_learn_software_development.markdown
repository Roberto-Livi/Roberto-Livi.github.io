Playing tennis and coding have been my two passions in life. Due to a career ending injury which had me retire from playing tennis, a sport that I played in for 20 years, I have decided to dedicate my life to my other passion (coding). I love to create and build programs, especially games. Every time I would build some type of game, I would quickly have someone from my household play it. 

I chose Flatiron School to be the one to turn my dream of being a top notch programmer into a reality. So many people have so much respect for this school and knows what it brings to the table. I am excited and nervous at the same time to start my cohort, but I know that if I am tenacious enough, i will be able to be successful in this program.
