I started out doing the Full Time immersive software engineering program. Coming into the full-time program, I was aware that it would be an every day, all-day grind, and I was ready for it. The first week commenced and I was putting in all of my time and effort. I was completing all the assignments on time and everything was going well thanks to my understanding of the basics of Ruby prior to starting this program. As lessons started to get harder, the pressure of not falling behind started to creep in. I would find myself trying to complete the assignments without really absorbing all of the material. I orginally chose a full-time program because I felt like I can commit to putting in a bunch of hours every day, but it just wasn't enough. After finishing a lesson that I didn't quite understand fully, I didn't want to rush into the next one. I want to really master what I learned before moving on to the next lesson. 

Since I found myself rushing through the assignments, I decided that part-time would be the right fit for me. I am currently doing the part-time program and its been so much better for me personally. Completing the program in 5 months with the full-time program does sound more exciting than finishing it in 10 months, but I believe that the wait will be worth it in order for me to be a better software engineer. This is not to say that I will have too much time to complete assignments with the part-time program, but it is enough time for me to complete the assignments in a way where I find myself learning and understanding, instead of trying to rush and complete.
